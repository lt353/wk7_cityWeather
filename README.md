# weather
This code is largely a duplicate of wk7_weather with a few differences. 
Code displays a simple HTML page to obtain the CITY from the user instead of the zip code. that is used to obtain weather from Open Weather Map API. The output displayed will be a bit different, for example it will include information about humidity and wind speed.
